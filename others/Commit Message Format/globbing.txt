blank lines can be used for spacing
# - marks line as a comment
* - matches 0 or more characters
? - matches 1 character
[abc] - matches a, b, _or_ c
** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
    a/z
    a/b/z
    a/b/c/z
        
    So if all of the 50 images are JPEG images in the "samples" folder, we could add the following line to .gitignore to have Git ignore all 50 images.

    samples/*.jpg
